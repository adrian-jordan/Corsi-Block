***Set up***

Initial set up requires adjustment of the line presented on the screen to 10cm to match the measurements given in Kessels et al. (2000).
The screen may be too small to allow an exact scale ratio of 1:1. If this is the case the line can be made shorter, to reduce the scale ratio.
If the initial set up is incorrect the settings file should be deleted and the program will allow the line measurement to be set again.

***Options***

The Corsi block program allows both forwards and backwards spatial recall and practice trials for either condition (practice trials can be skipped at the start-up menu).

***Procedure***

The Corsi block program will present the series to be remembered. After presentation of the series, participants will click on the blocks in the order they believe to be correct and press continue once done.

If participants get at least one of the two trials per spatial span length, they will proceed to the next spatial span length.

If participants get none of the two trials correct per spatial span length the experiment will end.

***Saving/Output***

Upon completion the data will be automatically saved in a file called "Corsi_data", located in a file called "data", which will be created in the working directory of the executable.
